What we learned during the 2025 Data Institute

This is a collection of what the 14 members of the <a href="https://cjddatainstitute.org/">The Data Institute</a>, a collaboration between the Center for Journalism & Democracy and the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting.

We'll use this page to add all the materials used to teach the 2025 Data Institute: slides, exercises, links, and homework. This is not an online course and won't have all the context or instruction to be a standalone class.
